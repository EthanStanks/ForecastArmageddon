<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>As part of the development team, I had several key responsibilities that contributed to the overall success of the game. In addition to creating all UI systems and elements, I also played a significant role in several other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Mainly, I worked on the card system. This was a central feature of the game that I designed and implemented. It allowed players to choose from a variety of cards, each with different towers, weather effects, buffs, and traps. These cards were delivered to the player through a unique conveyor belt system that I also designed. The card system added an additional layer of strategy to the game, as players had to decide which cards to use and how to best use them to defend against enemy attacks. Furthermore, the card system significantly contributed to the game's replayability by providing players with a wide range of cards to experiment with.</p>
<p>I was responsible for implementing the tower placement system using raycasting. This system allowed players to place towers with precision on the game board, ensuring that their defenses were strategically positioned to defend against enemy waves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I was responsible for creating the full weather system, which included different weather particles spawning at random depending on the round or a card the player uses. This system added an additional layer of strategy to the game, as players had to adapt their defenses to the changing weather conditions in order to successfully defend against enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Finally, I also contributed to the enemy spawn system, ensuring that the waves of enemies were challenging and engaging for players. By creating a system that progressively increased the difficulty of each wave, I helped to ensure that players were constantly engaged and challenged throughout the game.</p>
<p>Overall, my contributions were crucial to the success of the project, and I am proud to have played a key role in its development.</p>
